# Cube

## Dynamic Model

To start, I drew a model of the sytem and defined some variables.

$`\theta_w`$ - angle of the wheel

$`\theta_f`$ - angle of the frame

$`T`$ - motor torque

$`C_w`$ - friction torque coefficient

$`F_w`$ - force of gravity on the wheel

$`F_f`$ - force of gravity on the frame

I also defined the intertial axis such that +x is parellel to an unsloped surface and parallel to the cube face, +y is normal to an unsloped surface in the opposite direction as the force of gravity, and +z is in the direction of counterclockwise (CCW) wheel rotation. The origin O is placed at the corner of the cube touching the surface.

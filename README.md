# Cube

## Dynamic Model

To start, I drew a model of the sytem and defined some variables.

$`\theta_W`$ - angle of the wheel

$`\theta_F`$ - angle of the frame

$'T'$ - motor torque

$'C_W'$ - friction torque coefficient

$`F_w`$ - force of gravity on the wheel

$`F_f`$ - force of gravity on the frame

I also defined the intertial axis such that +x is parellel to an unsloped surface and parallel to the cube face, +y is normal to an unsloped surface in the opposite direction as the force of gravity, and +z is in the direction of counterclockwise (CCW) wheel rotation.
